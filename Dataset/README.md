# Evaluation Parameters
In our experiments, we have:

- We have three volunteers $U1-6$

- $f\_{evals} = 25$ function evaluations

- $r\_{init} = 5$ initial random samples after which the acquisition sampling begins

- $D = 512, \mathbf{R}^N$ is the high-dimensional space

- $d = 20, \mathbf{R}^d$ is embedding space
